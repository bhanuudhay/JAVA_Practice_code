This repository contains Java programs that cover a wide range of topics. Below are the major concepts demonstrated in the files.

# Major Topics

# 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts



Classes and Objects: Basic and advanced class structures, including Calculator.class, Car.class, Computer.class, and Student.class.


Encapsulation: Demonstrated in encapsulation.java where data is hidden within classes.


Inheritance: Showcased in files like inheritance.java and multiplelvlinheritance.java, explaining how one class can inherit properties from another.


Polymorphism: Covered in polymorphism.java, demonstrating method overloading and overriding.


# 2. Abstract Classes & Interfaces

Abstract Classes: Examples in abstractclass.java and abstractinner.java illustrate abstract classes and methods.

Interfaces: Demonstrated in interfacee.java and introinterface.java, showing how to define and implement interfaces.

# 3. Inner Classes & Anonymous Inner Classes
Inner Classes: Explained in innerclass.java where classes are defined inside other classes.

Anonymous Inner Classes: Examples in anonymousinnerclass.java, which shows how to implement classes on the fly.

# 4. Exception Handling

Try, Catch, Finally: The usage of exception handling mechanisms like in finallyblock.java and overide.java.


# 5. Multithreading & Concurrency

Threads: Demonstrated in files like lemdathreads.java and runnablethreads.java to show how multithreading works in Java.

Race Conditions: Shown in racecodition.java, explaining how multiple threads can cause unexpected behaviors.

# 6. Collections & Data Structures
Lists and Maps: Demonstrated in files such as listt.java and mapp.java, showing the use of Java Collections Framework.

Sorting: Examples in sortingg.java, which illustrate how sorting can be done using various techniques.


# 7. Lambda Expressions & Functional Programming

Functional Interfaces: Covered in functionalinterface.java and functionalinterfacee.java to demonstrate the use of functional interfaces in Java.

Streams: Shown in streamm.java, demonstrating how to work with streams in Java to perform functional-style operations.

# 8. Java Keywords & Core Concepts

Keywords: Files like finalkeyword.java, thiskeyword.class, and constructor.java explain the usage of important Java keywords like final, this, and constructors.

Method Overloading & Overriding: Demonstrated in overiding.java and constructor.java.

# 9. Enums & Sealed Classes

Enums: Explained in enumasclass.java and enumm.java, showing how to use enums in Java.

Sealed Classes: Covered in sealedclass.java, explaining the concept of sealed classes.
